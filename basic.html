            <h1>Software enginnering</h1>

            <p1>Software engineering is a branch of computer science which includes the development and building of
                computer
                systems software and applications software. Computer systems software is composed of programs that
                include
                computing utilities and operations systems. Applications software consists of user-focused programs that
                include
                web browsers, database programs, etc.

                There is a lot of investment going into software engineering at the moment due to the increasing
                reliance on
                mobile technology, venture capital-backed start-ups, the growing complexity of technology, and emerging
                industries. The demand for skilled and qualified software engineers seems to have no end. This demand is
                strengthened by a changing economic landscape and fueled by the need for technology solutions. With
                billions
                of
                physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet and that are collecting and
                sharing
                data, all industries are quickly becoming technology driven industries.

                Software engineers have extensive knowledge of programming languages, software development, and computer
                operating systems, and they apply engineering principles to software creation. By applying these
                engineering
                principles to every stage of the development process, from requirements analysis to the software
                process,
                they
                can create customized systems for individual clients. Just as a civil engineer will make sure that a
                bridge
                has
                a solid foundation, a software engineer will also begin with a thorough study of requirements and work
                through
                the development process in a systematic way.</p1>

            <h1>Bug bounty</h1>
            <p1>A bug bounty program is a deal offered by many websites,
                organizations and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for
                reporting bugs,
                especially those pertaining to security exploits and vulnerabilities. These programs allow the
                developers to
                discover and resolve bugs before the general public is aware of them,
                preventing incidents of widespread abuse. Bug bounty programs have been implemented by a large number of
                organizations,
                including Mozilla,
                Facebook,
                Yahoo !,
                Google,
                Reddit,
                Square,
                Microsoft,
                and the Internet bug bounty. Companies outside the technology industry,
                including traditionally conservative organizations like the United States Department of Defense,
                have started using bug bounty programs.The Pentagonâ€™s use of bug bounty programs is part of a posture
                shift
                that has seen several US Government Agencies reverse course from threatening white hat hackers with
                legal
                recourse to inviting them to participate as part of a comprehensive vulnerability disclosure framework
                or
                policy.</p1>

            <h1>Hardware hacking</h1>
            <p1>The word "hacking" as it pertains to hardware is often misused. In the commonly accepted definition,
                "hardware
                hacking"
                means modifying a piece of existing electronics to use it in a way that it was not necessarily intended.
                Even
                that
                definition is vague, as it can refer to any method of modifying hardware, be it the enclosure, the
                electronics,
                or the
                behavior. Modifying an enclosure of a device is usually straightforward; drill a hole, cut a slot, etc.
                But
                hacking the
                electronics and/or behavior is a complicated subject in itself. When looking to modify a device,
                sometimes
                it's
                hard to
                know where to start, and what angle of attack to take when hacking something for a purpose for which it
                was
                not
                designed.

                If you're looking to hack a piece of hardware, how you approach the hack depends on what you're trying
                to
                do.
                Are you
                trying to make it wireless? Are you trying to change what it displays? Are you trying to get it to
                trigger
                another
                device? Each hack requires a different angle of attack, and it's difficult to decide on how to proceed
                if
                you've
                never
                hacked a device before. What follows are some common methods of hardware hacking and the implementations
                in
                which they
                are used. This is not, by any means, a "how to hack hardware" tutorial. Such an article could not exist
                in a
                complete
                form. The nature of hacking insists that there is always a new creative way to a solution, but these are
                some
                common
                methods that I've used in my experiences.</p1>

            <h1>Hacking</h1>
            <p1>A computer hacker is a computer expert who uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem.
                While
                "hacker"
                can
                refer to any skilled computer programmer, the term has become associated in popular culture with a
                "security
                hacker",
                someone who, with their technical knowledge, uses bugs or exploits to break into computer systems.
                Law
                enforcement
                agencies have also been using hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other
                malicious
                actors
                using anonymity tools and the dark web to mask their identities online.</p1>
